# Advent of Code 2023

## About

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2023](https://adventofcode.com/2023) challenges using the [Rust Programming Language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) v1.74.0.

To run a solution (e.g. Day 1):

```sh
cd day_1
cargo run
```

*Note:* The solutions are not necessarily optimized for performance or readability, but rather for completing the challenge successfully.
